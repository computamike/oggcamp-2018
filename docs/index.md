# OggCamp Docs
Can I store my talk resources and project on a single github repository?

This repository will store the code and presentations for OggCamp 2018

[Presentations](https://computamike.github.io/oggcamp-2018/presentation) are available - including the somewhat in progress [Wild Errors](https://computamike.github.io/oggcamp-2018/presentation/wild_errors) presentation
